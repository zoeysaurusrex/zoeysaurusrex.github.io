I"×<p>Transition is finally beginning to become automatic for me. Iâ€™ve still got a lot of work to do with my voice and appearance, but Iâ€™m on the way. With that comes a renewed desire to put transition back into the box and let it become one facet of who I am. Part of moving on from transition means finding normalcy in being a woman. I find that these days, I want to just be a normal woman. I see my friends and coworkers doing normal things and I want that too.</p>
