I"÷<p>Iâ€™ve been at this for nineteen months total and living fulltime for seven of those. Way back in January of 2018, a prominent member of the trans community gave me the most important advice everâ€“Not all reactions are final. What does this mean? It means that when you come out, some will reactive negatively and positively and that either type of reaction can change over time. Itâ€™s fairly self-explanatory, but the part I want to hone in on are the reversals of positive reaction reversal.</p>
