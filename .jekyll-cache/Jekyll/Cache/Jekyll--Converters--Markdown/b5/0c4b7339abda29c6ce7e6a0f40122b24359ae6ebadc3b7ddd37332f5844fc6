I"¨<p>Transition is finally beginning to become automatic for me. Iâ€™ve still got a lot of work to do with my voice and appearance, but Iâ€™m on the way. With that comes a renewed desire to put transition back into the box and let it become one facet of who I am. Part of moving on from transition means finding normalcy in being a woman. I find that these days, I want to just be a normal woman. I see my friends and coworkers doing normal things and I want that too.</p>

<p>Since the start of my transition, Iâ€™ve wanted for the women in my life to include me when they do things with other women. I donâ€™t fault anyone for my expectations not being met, but itâ€™s still something I desire. Back in Nashville, I worked with quite a few women. While they openly supported me, I was still never thought of enough to be included in their outings. At first I thought it was just me, and maybe it was. When we would get new women in the office, I often found they were included even when I wasnâ€™t. It just serves to reinforce that feeling in my mind that despite having many supporters, not many women see me as enough of a woman to include me in the things they do with their gal pals.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t just exclusive to Nashville. In my four months in Seattle, Iâ€™ve experienced much of the same. The worst of it shows up when standing in a group of women and we all start talking about doing something fun, only for all of them to make plans and exclude me from the conversation. Iâ€™ve had at least one person tell me Iâ€™d have better luck in finding meetups with other Transwomen and it isnâ€™t really about that. Itâ€™s about finding people you have a ton in common with, only for them to not be willing to take the next step in friendship.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t to say that I donâ€™t have a ton of great experiences. Despite the false starts in Seattle, I think Iâ€™m making friends with one or two amazingly strong women. They strive to include me and theyve made it clear that im a woman to them. There is light and hope here for the first time in a long time. Iâ€™ve always been the type to prefer a few deep friendships over a ton of shallow ones and maybe that isnâ€™t possible for me anymore.</p>
